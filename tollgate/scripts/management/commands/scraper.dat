[oui]
; This file contains a list of rules for the scraper
;
; Basically, you put in a regular expression here, and it'll match everything
; that matches it to a particular company name.
;
; All matches are done case-insensitive.
;
; It's designed to "normalise" all the different names in the oui.txt data.
;
; You shouldn't need to normally modify this file, unless you're planning on
; changing the way that ouiscraper behaves, or trying to add more entries to
; the database.
;
; Helpful SQL to find common vendors that are unmatched:
;   select count(*) a, full_name from frontend_oui where slug='pc' group by full_name order by a desc limit 10;

; Be careful of "Applera Holding" here...
