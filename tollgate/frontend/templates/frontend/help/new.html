<h2 id="2.8.4">Changes in 2.8.4 (November 2010 - December 2011)</h2>
<p>Preparations for an open-source release.  This is what's done:</p>
<ul>
	<li>StreetGeek and SAGA-specific bits have been removed.</li>
	<li>External forum integration hacks have been removed.</li>
	<li>Implemented local sign-in and events management system.</li>
	<li><strong>Security:</strong> Fixed issue where arbitrary protocols could be used on the captive landing page, allowing XSS.</li>
	<li>Added IPv4 port forwarding support.</li>
</ul>



<p>This is what needs doing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Migration to the Jabberwocky database system.</li>
	<li>General code cleanup.</li>
	<li>Remove legacy Django bits, replace with 1.2 code.</li>
	<li>FIX BUGS</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="2.8.3">Changes in 2.8.3 (September 2010)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Updated internal documentation.</li>
	<li>Removed documentation that isn't used anymore in favour of the wiki.</li>
	<li>Server-side graph generation replaced with client-side (javascript) one for peformance reasons.</li>
	<li>"My devices and quota" now only updates the information from the kernel space if it hasn't happened in the last 2 minutes.</li>
	<li>API allows cookie-based authentication for faster authentication and better browser integration.</li>
	<li>Clustering support.</li>
	<li>UserProfile objects returned by the API now return the user's Forum UID, so username changes can be handled by API callers, and better integrate with the website.</li>
	<li>API now implements new <code>python</code> output method, which is the output from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#repr">repr()</a> function.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.8.2">Changes in 2.8.2 (July 2010)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A user's first and last name is no longer returned by any API call except for whoami().  Other methods which request a UserProfile object will have empty strings instead of the user's name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.8.1">Changes in 2.8.1 (May 2010)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Clarified the "no api" login error message reasons, because there are more reasons why it can occur than were listed.</li>
	<li>Added a test version of the 'modern' and 'platinum' themes.  These are incomplete.</li>
	<li>Out-of-subnet error page was not added to version control, now it is.</li>
	<li><code>libiptc-python</code> removed, as it is no longer required.</li>
	<li>Fixed captivity bug where a user with unlimited quota would be forever stuck captive.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.8.0">Changes in 2.8.0 (January 2010)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an exploit that would allow an attacked user to gain unlimited internet quota through an issue with external authentication.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where calls to the Django-side API would not convert the user_id to a string.  This is now done in the API, so these calls will now (implicitly) succeed.  This fixes an issue where quota wasn't automatically being recorded as part of the crontab job.</li>
	<li>Quota data is now automatically recorded every 10 minutes with history.</li>
	<li>There is a bandwidth graph showing a 10-minute average of metered internet usage over time.</li>
	<li>'cake' and 'terminal' themes now have text boxes fully enclosed, rather than just an underline.</li>
	<li>Removed some duplicate code relating to quota reporting to backend.</li>
	<li>Reworked backend to use <code>xt_quota2</code> instead of the normal iptables quota module.</li>
	<li>tollgate is now finally captive!  YAY!</li>
	<li>Fixed an error in the "internet login success" page where it would either not display at all or still show the survey banner on some browsers.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where external IP addresses could be logged into tollgate.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where IP changes might not be taken into account because expired entries in the ARP cache were not ignored.</li>
	<li>Admin: Internet usage report now defaults to being sorted by username alphabetically instead of by user ID.</li>
	<li>Admin: Internet usage report includes current speed of user's traffic.</li>
	<li>i18n: Started adding internationalisation hooks.</li>
	<li>API: Added HTTP GET API with json, pickle and csv output modes.</li>
	<li>Removed support for <code>libiptc-python</code> in backend.</li>
</ul>

	<li><code>coffee_ip</code> <a href="{% url "help-api" %}">API call</a> added.</li>

	<li>Internet connectivity is no longer switched on on login <strong>if</strong> you have previously disabled internet connectivity and haven't selected to sign the current computer on in your name.</li>
	<li>Backend not running will no longer cause EventAttendance migration failure on login.</li>
	<li>Clarified the meaning of "structure" in the API help to mean a dict(ionary).</li>

	<li>Reset logging implemented.</li>
	<li>Network host changes now logged.</li>

</ul>
