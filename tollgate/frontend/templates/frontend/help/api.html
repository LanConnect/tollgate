<p>tollgate has an API allowing for applications to pull some data from the portal system and interact with it.</p>

<p>As of 3.0.0, this API has been entirely rewritten to be RESTful, but the same functionality is available.  Please see the <a href="{% url 'api_index' %}">autogenerated API documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Applications designed for older versions of the API will break.
