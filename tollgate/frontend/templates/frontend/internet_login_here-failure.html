{% block title %}internet login error: cannot find mac{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p>There was a problem resolving your MAC address, and it couldn't be found in the ARP cache.  <strong>Please contact the network administrator for assistance.</strong></p>

<p>This happens primarily for one of these reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You are accessing tollgate from the server itself.</li>
	
	<li>
		<p>The platform that tollgate is running on (the server) is not supported.  Currently only Linux is supported.</p>
		
		<p>In development, running the software on other platforms will throw this error, and can be ignored.  In production it can not.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>The server's ARP cache can not be accessed.  This could be caused by restrictive SELinux policies.</li>
	
	<li>The server's ARP cache is full.  Please see the <code>README</code> for information on how to tune the ARP cache, and performance tuning on larger networks.</li>
</ol>
