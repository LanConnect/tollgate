<p>You should be able to access the internet now, if you have quota available.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> All internet access is metered, including uploads and downloads.  You have a limited amount of quota available, please see the <a href="{% url 'quota' %}">quota page</a> to show the current status.</p>

<p>Disable programs that are downloading in the background, pause Steam updates, and <strong>shut down peer to peer programs, such as Bear Share, Bittorrent, Gnutella, Hamachi, Limewire, Skype and World of Warcraft (under some configurations)</strong>.  <strong>Both uploads and downloads are counted</strong>, and the unmetered sites list is <strong>not</strong> the same as what is available on your ISP, <strong>nor the same as the ISP we are using</strong>.  Failure to comply with this will result in <em>termination</em> of your internet connectivity after you exceed your quota.</p>

<p>Downloads from local file shares on the LAN are unmetered.</p>

<p>You will be taken back to the <a href="{% url 'index' %}">main portal page</a> in 30 seconds.</p>
