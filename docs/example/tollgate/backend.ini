[tollgate]
; These are system settings for the firewall controller component of tollgate.
;
; This is an example configuration.
; Please leave it as such in version control.

; What message to send to reject packets.
; `icmp-admin-prohibited`
;  - is best, however not everything supports it. (RFC 1812, released 1995)
;  - requires linux kernel >=2.4.21 on firewall (November 2002)
;
; `icmp-net-unreachable`
;  - this is the default behaviour.
;  - everything supports it.
;  - makes it seem the internet is down or disconnected.
reject_mode = icmp-net-unreachable

; Should TCP RST (reset) packets be used for TCP connections that are denied?
; This will terminate open connections that are rejected, and issue "connection
; failed" messages.
;
; This will generally make rejected connections made by software fail a LOT
; faster than using ICMP error codes, so it is generally recommended.
reject_reset_tcp = yes

; You shouldn't have to change this.
; Set to /bin/echo for debugging
iptables = /sbin/iptables

; Interface that faces the LAN
internal_iface = eth1

; Interface that faces externally.
external_iface = eth0

; Tweaks the size of the ARP table to allow more hosts.
; If set, this will adjust the ARP garbage collection thresholds.
; You will need to set this if you have >128 hosts on your network.  Please
; read the documentation about larger deployments.
arp_table_size = 512

; You shouldn't need to change these...
allowed_rule = p2_allowed
unmetered_rule = p2_unmetered
blacklist_rule = p2_blacklist
ip4pf_rule = p2_ip4pf
captive_rule = p2_captive
user_rule_prefix = p2u_
limit_rule_prefix = p2l_

; Enables a debug mode.  This causes the backend to print out all the
; commands it tries to run.
debug = yes

[captive]
; Enable support for the captive mode.
enable = yes

; Port number the captive listener is running on.
; There should be a web server running redirecting to the "captive landing" page
; that listens on this port.  In apache2, you should have it listening on port
; 81 (or whatever port you set) AS WELL, with a mod_python.cgi to
; captive_landing/index.py
;
; You should change this as appropriate for your setup
port = 50080

[unmetered]
; These sites are always accessible and are unmetered.
;
; This can be in some forms, eg:
;    172.19.230.1           -- all traffic to a host
;    172.19.230.0/24        -- all traffic to a subnet
;    172.19.203.1:80        -- all traffic to a host on a port (tcp + udp)
;    172.19.203.1:53/udp    -- all traffic to a host on a port (udp only)
;    172.19.203.1:80/tcp    -- all traffic to a host on a port (tcp only)
;    172.19.203.1:*/tcp     -- all traffic to a host on a protocol
;    172.19.203.0/24:80/tcp -- all traffic to a subnet on a port (tcp only)
;    0.0.0.0/0:80/tcp       -- all traffic on a port (tcp only)
;    example1:www/tcp       -- all traffic to a named host with a named port (tcp only)
;
; You can use basically any combination of those rulesets.
;
; DNS names can be used for hosts, however it is NOT RECOMMENDED unless you
; are reading entries from your HOSTS file.  You can also use names for services
; as well.
;
; Note: these rules are NOT read in any particular order.

; Make sure each rule has it's own unique label.

; You must make sure the tollgate machine itself is marked as unmetered to
; bypass captivity issues
tollgate         = 10.4.0.1



[blacklist]
; Same format as the unmetered site list.  These are ports and sites that will
; ALWAYS be blocked.
;
; As an example, you may want to block access to the ADSL router that this
; system is NAT'd behind, or prevent access to an external DNS server (as some
; worms will redirect clients to a third-party poisoned DNS server via rogue
; DHCP responses) or SMTP mailserver (due to spam).
